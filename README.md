Demonstration of hangman
The program begins by showing the user a list of five topics to play with
The topics include:
Hollywood celebrities
Software companies
Car manufacturers
Phone manufacturers
Rock bands

Once the user chooses a topic, the program will randomly select a word to guess from the respective file and ask the user to input single characters; just like a regular hangman game
